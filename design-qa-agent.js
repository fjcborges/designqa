// Write a prompt that asks Claude to compare the diff against the

//   - Reference the manifest explicitly, don't just say "the design system"
//   - Say what counts as an issue: breaking a rule in the manifest,
//     and nothing else. Then adding a rule to the manifest is enough
//     to start checking it, with no change to this prompt
//   - Ask for structured reasoning, not just a verdict
//
// IMPORTANT: whatever you ask for, it must come back as valid JSON in
// exactly this shape, because that's what the code below expects:
//   {
//     "pass": true or false,
//     "findings": [
//       { "file": "...", "line": "...", "issue": "...", "reasoning": "..." }
//     ]
//   }
// If there are no issues, "pass" should be true and "findings" empty.
// ============================================================
function buildPrompt(diff, manifest) {
  return `You are a design QA reviewer. Check the pull request diff below against the component manifest below. The manifest is the only source of truth: you are not given any other files, so judge only what appears in the diff.

What counts as an issue:
- A line the diff adds or changes (lines starting with "+") that breaks something in the manifest: an entry in "rules", "accessibilityRules", or "responsiveRules", a deprecated variant listed under "deprecatedVariants", or a variant/size not listed under "approvedVariants"/"approvedSizes".
- Nothing else. Do not flag general style opinions or anything the manifest does not cover. Do not flag removed lines or unchanged context lines.
- Only review UI source files (e.g. .tsx, .jsx, .css, .html). Ignore changes to manifest.json, scripts, and config files.
- The "spacingScale" keys are Tailwind utility suffixes, so classes like p-md, py-xl, gap-lg, and pt-sm are correct, approved usage. Do not flag them.

Work through every added line and check it against every rule in the manifest, one rule at a time, before deciding. Do not stop after the first few findings.

For each issue, report the file path, the line number in the new version of the file (count from the "+start" number in the @@ hunk header), what is wrong, and which manifest rule it breaks and why.

If the diff contains no UI changes, or no issues, that is a pass.

Your entire response must be a single JSON object. Do not write anything before or after it: no explanation, no markdown fences. Put any explanation inside the "reasoning" fields. Use exactly this shape:
{
  "pass": true or false,
  "findings": [
    { "file": "src/App.tsx", "line": "40", "issue": "short description", "reasoning": "which manifest rule this breaks and why" }
  ]
}
"pass" is true only when "findings" is empty.
